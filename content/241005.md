title: Why need to fork() twice for daemonizing?
---
# Daemonizing
Daemonizing means keeping a process running independently, completely detached from **user session**

## Session
When a user logs into Linux, a user session is assigned to them. This session manages all the processes that the user runs.
Therefore, if the user logs out, all processes running in that session are terminated.
So, you should escape from this fence.

## Process Group
A process has three IDs: PID(Process ID), PGID(Process Group ID), SID(Session ID).
A process crates its own group and becomes the leader of that group.

# First fork()
We need to create a new session to detach from the existing session. However, the process group leader canâ€™t create a new session.
Therefore, it must first create a child process using `fork()`, and this child process can then create a new session.

```
fork() // Make a child
exit() // Kill parent
Setsid() // Make new session
```
Through the above sequence, we can create an orphaned, independent process that is detached from the session.
# Second fork()
This state is good enough, but the process is still the session leader. Therefore, it can reattach to the session using functions like `getty()`
To create a completely independent process(i.e., a daemon), we need to perform a second `fork()`
```
fork() // Make child
exit() // Kill parent
```

# Example Code
```c
void daemonize() {
	pid_t pid = 0;


	// First fork()
	pid = fork(); // Create a child
	if(pid < 0) // If failed
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	if(pid > 0) // Kill parent
		exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);

	if(setsid() < 0) // Create a new session
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	signal(SIGCHLD, SIG_IGN);

	// Second fork()
	pid = fork(); // Create a child
	if(pid < 0)
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	if(pid > 0) // Kill parent
		exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);


	umask(0);
	chdir("/");

	for(int fd = sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX); fd > 0; fd--)
		close(fd);
	stdin = fopen("/dev/null", "r");
	stdout = fopen("/dev/null", "w+");
	stderr = fopen("/dev/null", "w+");

	if(pid_file_name != NULL) {
		char buf[256];
		pid_fd = open(pid_file_name, O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0640);
		if(pid_fd < 0)
			exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
		if(lockf(pid_fd, F_TLOCK, 0) > 0)
			exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

		sprintf(buf, "%d\n", getpid());
		write(pid_fd, buf, strlen(buf));
	}
}
```
